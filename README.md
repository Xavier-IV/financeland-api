# FinanceLand API

This REST API is provided to complement [FinanceLand](https://github.com/Xavier-IV/financeland).

# Prerequisites

- NodeJS, v14
- NPM, v6.14

There will be sample environment variables for you in `.env.example` that you can modify
to your use-case.

# Quick setup

```bash
$ npm install
$ cp .env.example .env
$ npm run start:dev
```

Your API will be running at the port you have set in `.env` above. 

If you are running these 2 projects locally, it is recommended to use Port `3100` as to not
conflict with FinanceLand frontend application running on port `3000`.
